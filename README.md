# Free Loom-like Alternative

An intuitive Chrome extension that provides a draggable webcam feed on your browser, similar to Loom, but with a twist. Easily start, stop, and move your video feed around your browser window.

## Features

- **Start and Stop Webcam**: Toggle your webcam feed with a click.
- **Draggable Webcam Feed**: Move the feed anywhere on the browser window.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Drag the video feed, and it enlarges by 50% for better visibility, reverting to the original size after a brief moment. [TODO]
